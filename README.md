Emergency services CAD system monitor for apparatuses. Originally designed to interface with [QVEC](http://qvec.org)'s Aegis system

## Development

If you need to run tests, adjust the `.env.test` file in the monitor directory.  These are for unit tests, and do not affect the functionality of the actual library.
